                    <p>I love to capture people's stories. I strive to capture the emotion and energy of your special day, and all the raw and honest moments in between.</p>

                    <h4 className='text-uppercase'>We are shy / awkward and don't like being in front of the cameraâ€¦</h4>
                    <p>I know how you feel, I am too. But don't worry, you'll soon forget I'm even there as we relax into the day. My role is to be in the background, unobtrusive but always working to capture you in the most natural way, catching the genuine laughter, quiet romantic moments, tears, and joy. I will offer some direction if needed but I love to keep it as genuine as possible and just let you be yourselves.</p>
